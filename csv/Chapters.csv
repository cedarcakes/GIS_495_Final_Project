It is possible that the easier options available to these people are convenience     stores and fast food restaurants. Often, food from these facilities are marked as     having high glycemic index and loads. Over time, high calorie diets could cause increases     in weight gain and the risk of chronic disease development. Residents of poorer     neighborhoods typically have higher BMI and BMI increased when shopping in     impoverished areas. This could be an implication of the relationship between high     calorie diets and low income neighborhoods. Additionally, these neighborhoods could     be at higher risk of both chronic disease and cancer. These conclusions can be drawn     from the growing body of research linking cancers to high glycemic index and load,     coupled with our understanding of obesity on chronic disease risk. <br> Throughout this     project let’s explore the relationships between cancer rates, low income low access     populations, and fast food density.",8.0,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.7596,79.0193,https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/30362/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,1.0,,

Age     adjusting data ensures that age does not skew the data. For example, older     people are more likely to get cancer. It is important not to mistake higher     incidence rates coming from low income low access populations rather than the     high percentage of elderly. Swain, Anson, and Onslow all show higher     incidence rate and appear darker visually. Most counties     have incidence rates above 400 and the trend to lean toward     the upper end of the incidence rate scale.",9.0,Hidden,,Anson County,34.9055,80.1875,,0.0,,

8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,Limitations and Possible Solutions,,Cedar Abrams,,"The most important step in finding solutions is understanding what classified a community as low income low access. It could be not having enough stores in the area, not having transportation, or having enough money. If there are not enough stores in the area then encouraging development of a walmart could be beneficial. <br> Canned vegetables have nutrients     comparable to fresh vegetables. Food banks and non-profits could target these areas     as they often have supplies of canned goods. This could decrease the risk of     chronic disease development and increase the health of individuals in the community. <br>Encouraging community gardening would also be beneficial. Even if given more options, people might still choose less nutrient dense foods. Putting work into a community garden would encourage the use of its harvests. <br>Some limitations to accuracy include the years data was taken from. Rates data was taken from 2017-2020 whereas fast food data was from 2010. This 10 year gap leaves room for a large possible change in population which could result in less accurate findings. Additionally, looking into different types of non-linear correlation could improve the understanding of the relationships explored.  <br> Within this work, the relationship between low income low access populations and high calorie low nutrient diets has been inferred from previous studies.     Food swamps however, by definition, account for areas with greater concentrations     of less nutritious, high calorie, low nutrient foods. Using food swamp datasets     as opposed to low income low access datasets in comparison with cancer rates     could give a more accurate conclusion.",9.0,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.7596,79.0193,,0.0,,
