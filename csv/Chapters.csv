It is possible that the easier options available to these people are convenience     stores and fast food restaurants. Often, food from these facilities are marked as     having high glycemic index and loads. Over time, high calorie diets could cause increases     in weight gain and the risk of chronic disease development. Residents of poorer     neighborhoods typically have higher BMI and BMI increased when shopping in     impoverished areas. This could be an implication of the relationship between high     calorie diets and low income neighborhoods. Additionally, these neighborhoods could     be at higher risk of both chronic disease and cancer. These conclusions can be drawn     from the growing body of research linking cancers to high glycemic index and load,     coupled with our understanding of obesity on chronic disease risk. <br> Throughout this     project let’s explore the relationships between cancer rates, low income low access     populations, and fast food density.",15.0,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.0554878,-85.1498795,https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/30362/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,1.0,,

Lighter colors indicate lower incidence rate. Viewing left to right,     Mcdowell, New Hanover, and Northampton are not accounted for within the map.     <br> The Cancer rates data include invasive cancers only and are age adjusted. Age     adjusting data ensures that age does not skew the data. For example, older     people are more likely to get cancer. It is important not to mistake higher     incidence rates coming from low income low access populations rather than the     high percentage of elderly. Swain, Anson, and Onslow all show higher     incidence rate and appear darker visually. Most counties     have incidence rates above 400 and the trend to lean toward     the upper end of the incidence rate scale.",18.0,Hidden,,Anson County,35.4870477,-83.8842629,,0.0,,

Viewing left to right, Mcdowell and New Hanover are     not accounted for within the map. <br> Low income low access populations are     classified as being 200% or more below the federal poverty level. These     people don’t have access to supermarkets within 1 mile for urban areas and     10 miles for rural areas. <br> Swain and Dare both show more fast food restaurants     per 1,000 people. Most counties fall between 0 and 2, and lean toward the lower     end of the access scale. There is not another state to compare data to, it     could be that the two highest states are outliers that raise     the range of percentages for NC.",0.0,Hidden,,Swain County,35.771817,-78.6379858,,0.0,,

Lighter colors indicate lower population percentages.     Viewing left to right, Mcdowell and New Hanover are not accounted for within the map.     Bertie and Hyde both have a higher percentage of the population classified as low    income and low access. Hyde in particular shows 30% of the population as     low income and low access. There is not a lot of variation between counties,     this could be because of the fast food market. Having a restaurant density that     is too high could result in high competition, naturally lowering the density.",0.0,Hidden,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,

Lighter blue indicates    lower incidence rate. Higher fast food density is marked by darker red and     larger points. The size of the points corresponds with the population of     individuals that are low income and low access. Viewing left to right,     Mcdowell and New Hanover and Northampton are not accounted for rates and     fast food and Mcdowell and New Hanover are not accounted for access in the map.     Within both of the maps there is not a clear relationship between the variables.     Some counties have high incidence rate and low fast food density while others show     high incidence rate and high fast food density. This is the same can be said for     incidence rates and low income low access.",0.0,Hidden,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,
