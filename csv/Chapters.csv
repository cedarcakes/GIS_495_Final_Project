It is possible that the easier options available to these people are convenience     stores and fast food restaurants. Often, food from these facilities are marked as     having high glycemic index and loads. Over time, high calorie diets could cause increases     in weight gain and the risk of chronic disease development. Residents of poorer     neighborhoods typically have higher BMI and BMI increased when shopping in     impoverished areas. This could be an implication of the relationship between high     calorie diets and low income neighborhoods. Additionally, these neighborhoods could     be at higher risk of both chronic disease and cancer. These conclusions can be drawn     from the growing body of research linking cancers to high glycemic index and load,     coupled with our understanding of obesity on chronic disease risk. Throughout this     project letâ€™s explore the relationships between cancer rates, low income low access     populations, and fast food density.",0.0,Hidden,,North Carolina,35.7596,79.0193,https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/30362/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,1.0,,
1,1,1,1,Rates,media/Rates.jpg,Cedar Abrams,,"Figure 1 illustrates age-adjusted     cancer incidence rates per 100,00 people per County for North Carolina.     Lighter colors indicate lower incidence rate. Viewing left to right,     Mcdowell, New Hanover, and Northampton are not accounted for within the map.     The Cancer rates data include invasive cancers only and are age adjusted. Age     adjusting data ensures that age does not skew the data. For example, older     people are more likely to get cancer. It is important not to mistake higher     incidence rates coming from low income low access populations rather than the     high percentage of elderly. Swain, Anson, and Onslow all show higher     incidence rate and appear darker visually. Most counties     have incidence rates above 400 and the trend to lean toward     the upper end of the incidence rate scale.",0.0,Hidden,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,,
